Software for an autonomous car

## About

I have made this project with the help of an engineer at Continental Frankfurt. The purpose was to make an autnomous car with two distance sensors(left and right) that avoids obstacles to continue its journey.
<br>
We started by learning the basics of microcontrollers and how to program them, and eventually completed this project.
<br>
I have learned a lot of C programming techniques, including operations on bits and also learned to separate the software into three layers, the [**lowest level layer**](Basic_SFWT/Basic_SFWT_Main.c), the [**conversions and operations layer**](HAL/HAL_Main.c) and [**the application layer**](Aplicatie/Aplicatie_Main.c).
